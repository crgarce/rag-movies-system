His attempts at flirting are always seen as creepy by women, resulting in frequent rejections. One night, Stacey attends a showing of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid at a theatre and deliberately accosts the women sitting next to him, so they will recall him. As the movie plays, he heads for the theatre's bathroom, strips naked, puts on gloves and slips out though a window. He tracks Betty, a co-worker who had rejected his advances, down to a wooded area, and observes her having sex with her boyfriend in the back of a van. He ambushes the couple, kills the boyfriend and chases her into the forest, eventually catching up to her and stabbing her to death.

Stacey stabs her to death in the kitchen and resumes searching for the diary, only to find it missing; Kessler had already acquired it from Karen during his questioning.  Eventually, Stacey is formally arrested and charged. Kessler decides to plant evidence in order to frame Stacey and put him away for good; when McAnn discovers this, he confronts Kessler and refuses to go along out of fear of committing perjury, as he had been called to the witness stand in the case.

14 Going on 30,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/14_going_on_30.jpg,"14-year-old Danny O'Neil is madly in love with his teacher, Miss Peggy Noble. Given the fact that she is engaged to the cold-tempered and vicious gym teacher, Roy Kelton, who is nicknamed Jackjaw for his constant threat of breaking his pupils' jaws, Danny goes through his school days somewhat uninspired and suffers in silence.  One day, he oversees his geeky friend Lloyd Duffy, an orphan who happens to live next door with his uncaring uncle Herb and ditsy aunt May, growing fruits with an experimental growth accelerator. Danny becomes obsessed with the idea of turning himself into a grown man with the same machine, in order to break up Miss Noble's engagement, as well as convincing her to give him a chance. Lloyd is reluctant to help him out, aware of everything that could go wrong, so Danny secretly breaks into his lab and uses his machine that very night, seeing that the timing was perfect, considering that his parents will be leaving the house for a week. Not caring about the potential consequences, he turns himself into a 30-year-old man.  The next day, Lloyd immediately starts working on a machine with the opposite effect so he can return Danny to his 14-year-old self. Meanwhile, Danny visits the high school to pursue Miss Noble. When he arrives, he is promptly mistaken for the school's new principal, Harold Forndexter, who should have arrived to take up his position that morning (the real Forndexter has been delayed, but due to a miscommunication the school was not informed). Playing along with their misconception,  Danny not only impresses his assistant Louisa Horton with the introduction of his new rules - which include having as much fun as possible - but also Peggy, who admires his youthful approach of life.  Lloyd, however, is having no luck with his attempts to turn Danny back to his younger age, as all of his prototype machines killed the tomatoes he used as test subjects. Lloyd is also becoming slightly jealous of Danny, who now seems to have total freedom, unlike Lloyd, who's stuck with an adoptive family that never wanted him, and he begins to openly wonder what it would be like to become a man too. Unconcerned with all this, Danny continues to pursue a relationship with Peggy. Much to the dismay of Kelton, she agrees to go on a date with Danny, Even though Kelton follows their every step. Peggy has a splendid evening with the new principal, and they almost kiss at the end of the night.  During a school dance, Danny finally convinces Peggy that Kelton is not right for her, and she breaks off the engagement. By this time, Lloyd has finally completed a working machine. But when he goes to inform Danny, he discovers that the 'Harold' persona has completely taken Danny over and he refuses to change back, telling Lloyd that he likes his new body and life, and that he's never becoming Danny again. Immediately afterwards, Danny and Peggy become a couple. Kelton, refusing to accept this, tries to find out more on Forndexter, and discovers that 'Harold' is an impostor. He immediately informs the police, who arrive quickly to arrest him, giving Danny no choice but to transform back into a kid.  While Danny tries to escape, Lloyd prepares the machine for him. After getting rid of the cops, 'Harold' tells Peggy that he has to leave town for good, and then, after returning to Lloyd's lab, becomes Danny again. However, Peggy followed him and witnesses his transformation, now realising that 'Harold' was actually Danny, one of her favourite students. Because she has fallen in love with him, she convinces Lloyd to use the same machine to turn herself into a 14-year-old, which enables her to be with Danny. Meanwhile, in order to escape his abusive family, Lloyd finally gives in to temptation and uses the machine to turn himself into a professor, called Mr. Lloyd, and starts working at the same high school as a teacher."
18 Again!,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/18again_dvdcover.jpg,"Jack Watson is a millionaire playboy and businessman who is about to turn 81 years old just as his grandson David is about to turn 18, but Jack laments his old age and wishes to get back to his teens once more. When an accident switches their souls, Jack gets to live his grandson's life and all that it entails: school, sports, and romance. Unfortunately, David gets the ""short end of the deal"", as not only is he trapped in his grandfather's 81-year-old body, but he is also in a coma. The only one who knows the truth is his longtime friend Charlie, whom Jack was able to convince by recounting experiences only they knew.  Jack gets to approach his family from a fresh point of view and doesn't always like what he sees: he's been a distant parent for his son Arnie and has repeatedly disregarded his ideas for improving the family company. The college fraternity that he coerced David into joining (his old alma mater) is bullying him on a regular basis and forcing him to write their test finals for them. He also finds out that his girlfriend Madeline is unfaithful when she tries to seduce him, thinking he's Jack's grandson. Deciding to set things right, Jack in David's body decides to take charge by convincing his father (or rather, Jack's son) to implement his ideas on the family business and uses his poker playing skills to beat the frat boys while betting $1000 that he will beat the lead frat boy Russ in the upcoming track meet. Jack also impresses a girl named Robin, who is taken with David's old-fashioned style with bow ties and his vividly recounting the Second World War and meeting President Harry S. Truman.  However, Jack realizes too late that he has willed half of everything to Madeline, who convinces Arnie and his wife to disconnect Jack's 81-year-old body from life support. Knowing that this will kill David, Jack and Charlie rush to the hospital to prevent this, wheeling Jack's body away from an orderly. When they crash in the hospital chapel, Jack and David's minds are returned to their rightful bodies, and Jack awakens. Jack still has unfinished business, as in David's body he challenged the fraternity president to a race, and now David must face him.  Jack gives David a pep talk, and David beats the frat president. Jack then encourages David to pursue an interested Robin. In private, Jack tells Arnie that his greatest mistake was trying to get him and David to relive his own life, and encourages Arnie to nurture David's interest in art, which Jack will do as well by getting David involved in the graphic design aspect of the family business. Finally, Jack confronts Madeline by saying he knows that she made a pass at David and is well aware that she is a gold digger only interested in his bank account. He throws her out of the house and lets her know that he has rewritten his will to include his family and his faithful butler Horton, whom he promptly orders to have Madeline thrown out. Robin and David start their relationship, and the movie finishes with Jack telling David everything about Harry S. Truman."

2010: The Year We Make Contact,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/2010-poster01.jpg,"Nine years after the failure of the Discovery One mission to Jupiter in 2001, in which the crew of five including mission commander David Bowman were lost, an international dispute causes tension between the United States and the Soviet Union while both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the Discovery. The Soviet spacecraft Leonov will be ready a year before the American Discovery Two, but only the Americans can reactivate the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, thought to be responsible for the disaster. Upon learning that Discovery will crash into Jupiter's moon Io before the American mission can reach it, NASA persuades the Soviets to include Dr. Heywood Floyd, Discovery designer Walter Curnow, and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra on their mission.  Arriving at Jupiter, the crew detects chlorophyll on Jupiter's icy moon Europa, moving toward the sun at the rate of one meter per minute.  A probe sent to investigate is destroyed by an energy burst, which the Soviets believe to be electrostatic build-up, but which Floyd suspects is a warning to stay away from Europa. Finding Discovery adrift in orbit over Io, Curnow reactivates the ship, and Chandra restarts HAL. Cosmonaut Max Brailovsky investigates the nearby giant Monolith where Bowman disappeared, but his EVA pod is destroyed by a burst of energy.  On Earth, Dave Bowman, now an incorporeal being, appears through his former wife's television to say goodbye, telling her that ""something wonderful"" is going to happen. He then visits his comatose mother in a nursing home. She briefly awakens, delighted by her son's presence, as Bowman gently brushes his mother's hair.  After he departs, Mrs. Bowman dies peacefully.  Chandra discovers the reasons for HAL's malfunction: the National Security Council ordered HAL to conceal information about the Monolith from the Discoverys crew, and programmed him to complete the mission alone. This conflicted with HAL's programming of open, accurate processing of information, causing the computer equivalent of a paranoid mental breakdown. When Bowman and copilot Frank Poole discussed deactivating the malfunctioning computer, HAL concluded that the human crew was endangering the mission, and terminated them. Although the NSC's order bears his signature, Floyd angrily denies having known of it.  Back on Earth, the United States and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. The Americans are ordered to leave the Leonov and move to the Discovery, with no further communication between the crews. Both ships plan to leave Jupiter in several weeks' time, but Bowman appears to Floyd, and says that everyone must leave within two days. Floyd confers with the skeptical Soviet captain, Tanya Kirbuk. As the crews agree to cooperate on an emergency departure, the Monolith suddenly disappears, and an ominous black spot appears in Jupiter's atmosphere. Neither ship has the fuel to reach Earth if they leave ahead of schedule, so the ships are docked together, and placed under the control of HAL 9000. Discoverys remaining fuel will be burned to propel the Leonov away from Jupiter; then Discovery will be undocked and left behind.  HAL determines that the spot is a vast group of smaller Monoliths, multiplying exponentially and altering Jupiter's mass and chemical composition. He suggests canceling the launch in order to study the changes occurring to Jupiter. Floyd worries that HAL will prioritize his mission over the humans' survival, but Chandra admits to the computer that there is a danger, and that Discovery may be destroyed. HAL thanks Chandra for telling him the truth, and ensures the Leonovs escape. Before Discovery is destroyed, Bowman asks HAL to transmit a priority message, assuring him that they will soon be together. The Monoliths engulf Jupiter, which undergoes nuclear fusion, becoming a new star. HAL transmits this message to Earth:  The Leonov survives the shockwave from Jupiter's ignition, and returns home. Floyd narrates how the new star's miraculous appearance, and the message from a mysterious alien power, inspire the American and Soviet leaders to seek peace. Under its infant sun, icy Europa transforms into a humid jungle, covered with life, and watched over by a Monolith."
48 Hrs.,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Forty_eight_hrs.jpg,"Convicted career criminal Albert Ganz escapes from custody with the help of his accomplice Billy Bear. They travel to San Francisco and kill Henry Wong, a former associate. SFPD Inspector Jack Cates, accompanied by Detectives Algren and Van Zant, trace Ganz & Bear to a hotel, where they've checked in under aliases. Ganz & Bear ambush the officers. In the ensuing shootout, Ganz kills Algren & Van Zant and escapes with Billy, taking Jack's service revolver.  Armed with a replacement pistol, Jack tracks down Ganz's former partner-in-crime Reggie Hammond, who is in prison with six months to go on a three-year sentence for armed robbery. After a memorable first meeting in prison, Jack manages to get Reggie a 48-hour release into his custody so that Reggie can help Jack find Ganz & Bear. Reggie leads Jack to an apartment where Ganz's last remaining associate Luther Kelly lives. When Jack looks around, Luther shoots at him and refuses to be interrogated, so Jack arrests Luther.  That night, Reggie leads Jack to Torchy's, a redneck hangout where Billy used to be a bartender. Reggie, on a challenge from Jack, shakes the bar down using Jack's badge, single-handedly bringing the crowd under his control. They get a lead on Billy's old girlfriend, but get nothing out of her, as the girlfriend says she threw Billy out. After tensions between the two men finally erupt into a fistfight that is stopped by a pair of patrol officers, Reggie finally confesses that he, Ganz, Bear, Luther & Wong had robbed a drug dealer of $500,000 some years earlier and that the money was (and remains) stashed in the trunk of Reggie's car in a downtown parking garage. Instead of splitting the cash, Ganz sold Reggie out, resulting in his incarceration. It was also the reason why Ganz & Billy took Luther's girlfriend Rosalie: they wanted Luther to get Reggie's money in exchange for her safe return.  However, Luther goes and gets the car, and Jack & Reggie tail him to a Muni station where Ganz comes to get the money. Luther, however, recognizes Jack, and Ganz & Billy escape, while Reggie chases after Luther. Left with nothing, Jack ends up going back to the police station and waits for Reggie to call. Jack goes to a nightclub in the Fillmore District, to find Reggie, who has tracked Luther to a hotel across the street. Jack, humbled, apologizes for continuously berating and insulting Reggie. He lends Reggie some money to pay for a hotel room to have sex with a girl he's met, but as Reggie leaves the club with her, he sees Luther leave the hotel. Luther gets onto a stolen bus driven by Billy and hands over the money to Ganz, who shoots Luther and presumably Rosalie. Ganz spots Jack & Reggie following them, and a car chase/gunfight ensues, which ends when Billy forces Jack's Cadillac through the window of a Cadillac showroom. At this point following a heated verbal thrashing from Jack's superior Haden, Jack & Reggie are ready to resign themselves to the fact that they failed to catch Ganz.  At a local bar, Jack wonders if Billy might go back to see his girl and use her place as a hideout. Jack & Reggie force their way inside and after a brief confrontation, Reggie shoots Billy. Ganz escapes into a maze of alleyways, capturing Reggie. Jack approaches and shoots  Ganz in the shoulder, throwing Reggie off him. Ganz then charges at Jack but Jack shoots him repeatedly, killing him. Finally, Jack takes Reggie to go see the girl he had met earlier in Fillmore. Jack leaves the money in Reggie's car but asks for a loan to buy a convertible when Reggie is released, to which Reggie agrees. Jack gives Reggie a stern warning about changing his ways once he's released, and Reggie agrees to do so, while half attempting to steal Jack's lighter. The two men share a laugh before driving back to the prison."

One day, Harry is confronted by three hooded blackmailers who demand $105,000 per year for a videotape of him and his mistress, a young stripper named Cini. Because of his wife's political aspirations, he cannot go to the police; however, guilt eventually drives him to confess, and she kicks him out of their bedroom.    Harry's stubborn inclination is to not surrender to the threats, and when his lawyer advises him that the blackmailers will never leave him alone, he refuses to pay.  The lead blackmailer breaks into Harry's house and steals Harry's gun and some items of his clothing.

Knowing he has a background in accounting, Harry shows Raimy his financial records, which indicate that the majority of his wealth is tied up and he can't afford $105,000. Raimy agrees to accept Harry's offer of $52,000 instead, at least as a first payment.   Through Doreen, a stripper who was friends with Cini, Harry learns the names of the other blackmailers: the sociopathic Bobby Shy and the cowardly Leo. He first makes Raimy suspicious by suggesting Leo gave up his name; Bobby, realizing the truth, violently interrogates Doreen but believes her when she says she didn't give him away. That night he breaks into the Mitchell house and tries to kill Harry, but Harry and Barbara overpower him. Harry realizes Raimy kept the revised deal to himself and tells Bobby as much before letting him go.  Leo, cracking under the pressure, confesses everything to Harry, saying he never wanted to hurt Cini and that both her body and the videotape have been disposed of. He also warns him that Raimy and Bobby will kill him and Barbara after the payment is made, since he knows who they are. Bobby later confronts Leo, who is planning to leave town, and kills him. Meanwhile, Raimy kidnaps Barbara and sedates her with drugs, to ensure Harry delivers the $52,000. He lures Bobby and Doreen to a warehouse and kills both of them before going to meet Harry.  Harry exchanges the money for Barbara, telling Raimy that if anything happens to them, his lawyer will send Raimy's fingerprints (from the financial records) to the police. Raimy had previously expressed interest in Harryâ€™s sports car, so Harry offers it as a getaway vehicle. When Raimy turns the ignition key the doors lock, trapping him inside; the car then explodes in a ball of fire."

After beheading the man with a machete, the hippie slashes the woman to death with a dagger, then sexually assaults her corpse. Charged with solving ""the Lake Front Butcher"" murders (as the media have dubbed them) are Sergeant Connor and Detective Haller, whose main suspect is the man who found the bodies, a retired army colonel named Peter Wayne. Routinely intruding upon the investigation is stubborn local reporter Susan Rather, the occasional lover of Assistant District Attorney Ralph Kennedy.  Over the next two nights two more couples are butchered, one in their van, and the other in an abandoned factory. The modus operandi (male killed with a machete, the female killed with a knife and raped post-mortem) is the same, and the theory that Wayne is the killer is strengthened when he goes into hiding. Shortly after another couple is killed (this time in their bedroom) on the fourth night, Connor finds Wayne, who he had discovered had lived in at least two of the four cities where similar crimes (five couples killed over the course of five nights, each spree five years apart) have occurred. However, due to a lack of solid evidence connecting him to any of the murders, Wayne (who claims to have only hid because he believed Connor was personally out to get him) is let go.  After Wayne's release, Connor and Haller are approached by Susan, who claims that Ralph is the Lake Front Butcher. Susan explains that she had earlier snuck into the station to look through the case files, and found out that the ex-boyfriend of the very first victim (murdered twenty years ago in Massachusetts alongside her lover) was named Joseph Ralph Dwyer, which is Ralph's birth name. Searching for Ralph, the trio track him down to the abandoned factory, where he is killed in a shootout, though only after claiming the lives of another young couple, completing his pattern for the fifth time."

Deducing that the drugs were stashed there, Scudder and Chance go to the grocery store and find the hidden cocaine. Scudder offers to return them in exchange for Sarah.  At an empty warehouse, Maldonado arrives with Sarah duct-taped to a shotgun that one of his underlings is holding.

When Hart turns down Violet for a promotion in favor of a man who is below her, she reveals to Doralee the rumor about the affair, leading both women to take the afternoon off drinking at a local bar. Judy joins them after learning of the dismissal of a friendly co-worker.  Unable to think of a way to improve their situation, they spend the evening smoking marijuana at Doralee's house and fantasizing about how they would get revenge on Hart: Judy would shoot him like a hunter does a deer, Doralee would hog tie him and roast him over a slow fire, while Violet would poison his coffee.  The next day, a frustrated Violet accidentally puts rat poison in Hart's coffee, but before he can drink it, his desk chair malfunctions and he blacks out after hitting his head on a credenza. Violet realizes her mistake and thinks the poisoned coffee caused Hart to black out. She and Judy meet Doralee at the hospital just in time to overhear a doctor pronounce another man dead from poisoning.  Thinking the dead man is Hart, Violet steals the body to prevent an autopsy, but while arguing with Judy and Doralee, she crashes her car, damaging a fender. When Doralee retrieves a tire iron from the trunk to fix the fender, she discovers the body is not Hart and they return it to the hospital.  The next morning, Hart shocks the women when he arrives for work as usual. In the ladies room, Doralee explains that Hart hit his head, but did not drink the coffee. Relieved that nothing will come out of the night's events, the ladies agree to meet for happy hour at the end of the day. However, Hart's loyal administrative assistant Roz overhears their conversation and reports everything back to him.  Hart summons Doralee to his office and offers her a choice: if she spends the night with him, he will not report her, Judy, and Violet for attempted murder. Doralee refuses and when Hart will not hear her out, she hogties him and stuffs a scarf he had given her as a gift in his mouth to keep him quiet. He eventually tricks Judy into loosening the binds, which leads her to shoot at him with Doralee's handgun.  Ultimately, the women discover Hart has been selling Consolidated inventory and pocketing the proceeds, so they blackmail him into keeping quiet. When they are told that invoices Violet ordered that should prove Hart's crimes will not arrive for 4â€“6 weeks, they confine Hart to his bedroom wearing a hang gliding suit tied to a remote controlled garage door opener.  While Hart is out of the office, they implement several programs that are popular with the workers, including an in-office daycare center, equal pay for men and women, flexible hours, and a job-sharing program where employees can work part-time.  Days before the invoices arrive, Hart's adoring wife returns from a cruise and frees him, giving him the time to buy back the inventory he sold. Before Hart can report Judy, Doralee, and Violet to the police, the chairman of the board, Russell Tinsworthy, arrives to meet with Hart. He congratulates him on his improvements to the office which have resulted in a 20% increase in productivity. As a result, he invites Hart to join him on a multiyear project in Brazil, which he reluctantly is forced to accept.  Violet, Judy, and Doralee celebrate their success. Violet is eventually promoted to vice president, Judy leaves Consolidated to marry the Xerox representative, and Doralee leaves to become a country western singer. Hart is kidnapped by a tribe of Amazons and is never heard from again."

While Spike is the neighborhood motorcycle bad boy, Hoax is an introverted nerd. Even though Spike genuinely cares for his cousin and protects him from bullies, Hoax is filled with resentment that he cannot stand up for himself or get the girl he wants (both of which Spike does effortlessly).

Spike loses interest in the line quickly, but Hoax soon discovers the true nature of the line and uses it to get revenge on everyone who has wronged him.  Soon Hoax's spirit is almost entirely consumed by Satan, who possesses Hoax to cause death and destruction, culminating in an opening to Hell appearing before their house.

After initial eliminations, sixteen hopefuls remain. Arriving late is former lead dancer Cassie (Alyson Reed) who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach but left him for Hollywood. Now she has not worked in over a year, and is desperate enough to be part of the chorus line.  Zach is looking for eight dancers (four men and four women) and has them introduce themselves. As they each step forward, he interviews them and coaxes the dancers into talking about a variety of topics. This includes how they began dancing, first sexual experiences, their families, and hardships they have faced.

A Christmas Story,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/A_Christmas_Story_film_poster.jpg,"thumb|The front of the Parkers' house where A Christmas Story was filmed in the Tremont neighborhood of Cleveland's west side. The building was restored and reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors and is open to the public as A Christmas Story House.  The film is presented in a series of vignettes, with narration provided by the adult Ralphie Parker. As a 9-year-old boy in 1940, all Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle. Ralphie's desire is rejected by his mother, his teacher Miss Shields, and a disgruntled Santa Claus at Higbee's department store, all of whom give him the same warning: ""You'll shoot your eye out"".  On Christmas morning, Ralphie receives some presents that he enjoys but is disappointed not to find the rifle among them. Ralphie's father (""The Old Man"") directs him to one last box hidden in the corner, which proves to contain the rifle. Ralphie eagerly hurries outside to try it out, but when he shoots at the metal target he has set up, the BB ricochets and knocks off his glasses. Ralphie accidentally steps on and breaks the glasses while trying to find them; he makes up a cover story about a large icicle falling and hitting him in the face, which fools his mother and keeps him from getting in trouble.  That night, Ralphie goes to sleep with the gun by his side, as his adult self reflects that it was the best Christmas present he had ever received or would ever receive.  Other vignettes Interspersed with the main story are several loosely related vignettes involving the Parkers:   The Old Man fights a never-ending battle with the malfunctioning furnace in the Parker home. His frustrations cause him to swear profusely (heard as gibberish in the film), leading Ralphie to suspect a cloud of profanity ""is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan"".   Ralphie's friends, Flick and Schwartz, argue about whether or not a tongue will stick to metal in the winter. Schwartz ""triple-dog dare""s Flick to try sticking his tongue to the schoolyard flagpole, and Flick does indeed get stuck, requiring the fire department's help to get him unstuck. Flick refuses to rat out Schwartz to Miss Shields, though she makes it clear she suspects either Schwartz or Ralphie is responsible.  The Old Man is delighted when he wins a ""major award"" in a newspaper contest â€“ a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg wearing a fishnet stocking. Mrs. Parker dislikes it, and the ensuing ""Battle of the Lamp"" ends with her ""accidentally"" breaking it. Unable to fix it, the Old Man buries it in the backyard.  Ralphie eagerly checks the mail each day for a secret decoder ring, which he earned through a promotion Ovaltine and the Little Orphan Annie radio show were running. However, when the ring finally arrives, and Ralphie decodes the secret message broadcast on the radio show, he is disappointed to find the message is merely an Ovaltine ad.  While unsuccessfully helping The Old Man change a blown tire, Ralphie accidentally lets an f-bomb slip, and gets his mouth washed out with Lifebuoy soap as a punishment. That night, he fantasizes about making his parents sorry, by becoming blind from soap poisoning.  Ralphie, his brother Randy, and Flick and Schwartz are tormented by the neighborhood bullies Scut Farkus and Grover Dill. Ralphie eventually snaps and attacks Farkus, unleashing a stream of vulgar gibberish similar to the Old Man's. Mrs. Parker halts him mid-fight and escorts him home; Ralphie and Randy expect The Old Man to ""kill"" Ralphie when he finds out, but Mrs. Parker manages to distract The Old Man by talking about football, earning Ralphie's respect.   Ralphie is dismayed to receive an embarrassing pink bunny footed sleeper from his Aunt Clara. Mrs. Parker forces him to try it on and thinks its adorable, but The Old Man calls it ""a pink nightmare"" and allows Ralphie to take it off. Mrs. Parker agrees to only have Ralphie wear it when Aunt Clara visits.  The Old Man is frequently chased by a pack of ""at least 785 smelly hound dogs"" owned by the Bumpus family, the Parkers' hillbilly neighbors. On Christmas Day, the dogs ruin the Parkers' dinner by romping through their kitchen and eating their turkey, forcing the family to go to a Chinese restaurant to eat, where they enjoy an entertaining dinner of ""Chinese Turkey""."
A Christmas Without Snow,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/A_Christmas_without_Snow.jpg,"A divorcee, Zoe Jensen (Michael Learned), moves to San Francisco from Omaha in an effort to rebuild her life. She has reluctantly left her young son back home with his grandmother until she is more financially secure. She joins a local church choir which has just gained a new, demanding choirmaster, retired music conductor Ephraim Adams (John Houseman).

Meanwhile, the choir overcome setbacks as they all deal with personal issues.  A teacher by profession, Zoe soon learns no positions are available and that she lacks training to perform more readily-available work. Living in an inexpensive apartment, she brushes up her typing skills in order to gain employment before her mother wearies of looking after her son, who is growing anxious from his separation from Zoe.  Zoe receives her grounding at church, where an assortment of inner-city residents range from a former opera singer to a student seeking to educate himself for a life in a profession. The opera singer falls by the wayside when ego gets in her way, while the student is falsely accused of vandalism to the church organ simply because of his race, yet is vindicated by those who know and believe in him. Together, they persevere in the church choir. Along the way, Zoe finds an office job and, with the help of a bargain hunter, prepares a pleasant home for her son and herself.  Unexpected talent abounds within the choir. The amateurs give their best as ones who perform for the love of the music. This love extends far beyond the choir loft and is exemplified when the choir members band together to make the needed repairs to the organ pipes.  At a pre-performance holiday dinner the choir sees a different side of Ephraim Adams as he presents gifts to the choir members and joins in the merriment. Weakness suddenly overtakes him and he collapses; at a local hospital it is determined he has had a stroke.  The choir performs Messiah admirably at the Christmas concert, accompanied by the vintage organ, with Adams in attendance in a wheelchair. The choir has progressed far beyond an unlikely group of city dwellers. They have become a family."

An extended flashback shows how Tracey and Buck met. Tracey was working in a hotel in Florida and came across Buck and his fellow construction workers. At first, Buck was a charming person, until, over time, he started to display raging tempers, even taking them all out on Tracey, telling her all about how his mother abused him as a child. Despite the violent outbursts, she agrees not to leave him. When she tells him that she is pregnant with his child, he punched her in the face and kicked her in the stomach. She then returns to Torrington, Connecticut, to be with her friends, Judy and Rick. Buck finds her and seemingly humbly apologizes for his behavior. He asked to marry her and promised to settle down in Connecticut. Tracey is hesitant, but when Buck promises never to hit her again, she agrees. After they got married, she gives birth to a boy, C.J.  Buck has no luck finding a job, so the family have no choice but to return to Florida. Over the next year, Buck manages to gamble away all their money, and continues to assault her, even in front of C.J. Tracey left him and returned to Torrington. The night after Tracey left for Torrington, Buck hopped in his pickup truck and drove all the way up to Torrington and hoped to surprise her while welcoming himself into the home she was staying at and told her that he found a job at a diner, but she didn't care. Tracey tells him to just stay away from her and grabs the phone, and he grabs their son C.J. and runs outside, Tracey calls the police where they find Buck feeding his son at work and have him clock out to take him into custody. The police said that she could have her son back if she and Buck reunite. Tracey decides to divorce Buck, and was given custody of her son without Buck seeing him for the time being. As she left, Buck attacks her in her own car. Buck is arrested, and Tracey issues a restraining order against him, but he continues to harass and threaten to kill her. Tracey goes to the police, but they did very little to help.  After the divorce is finalized, he shows up again, causing Tracey to call the police hoping that when they see him threatening her, they will arrest him. Buck demands Tracey to come out immediately, and when he stated that he wanted them back together, she refused to stop the divorce. When the police show up, Buck pulls out a knife and stabs her numerous times. He goes into the house and grabs C.J., showing him his injured mother lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Many neighbors witness Buck still assaulting Tracey, and yet the police fail to intervene. It wasn't until after Tracey was loaded in the ambulance that Buck was finally apprehended.  In the hospital, Tracey's lawyer, Burton Weinstein, together with Tracey's sister, discuss filing a civil lawsuit against the Torrington police department for not protecting her. Tracey spent months recuperating, and Buck is sentenced to 20 years in prison with the possibility of parole in 1991. Tracey is apprehensive about the possibility of his parole, knowing that upon his release, he would be coming after her. However, Weinstein is able to keep Tracey focused on the lawsuit. Following the civil suit trial, the jury rules in favor of Tracey, finding that her rights were violated, and she is awarded $2,300,000. She is also granted a permanent restraining order against Buck and he will not be allowed to contact C.J. or Tracey for the rest of their lives. Happy with the decision, she hugs Weinstein. In real life, Tracey was remarried to Michael Motuzick; Michael was granted permission to adopt C.J. so the family could build their lives together."
A Day of Judgment,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/49/A_Day_of_Judgment_poster.jpg,"In a small Southern town in the 1920s, the residents have slowly begun to break away from religious life, leaving the Reverend Cage's weekly sermons attended only by three devout elderly women. The Reverend Cage has chosen to leave the local church, and visits the local bank to negotiate a loan he has taken out, but finds himself a victim of usury from Mr. Sharpe, the unscrupulous head banker. Late that night, while departing the town, the Reverend encounters a cloaked figure on horseback brandishing a scythe pass by him on a covered bridgeâ€”the figure resembles that of the Grim Reaper.  The following day, Mrs. Fitch, an elderly alcoholic, harasses young children playing on her property, and also chastises her housekeeper, Alma. When the local sheriff fails to take Mrs. Fitch's complaints seriously, she poisons the children's pet goat, killing it. Meanwhile, George Clay, a local man who runs the service station his elderly parents own, dreams of abandoning his responsibilities. While at work, George openly tells his parents he aspires to sell the family business once they die. George consults Griggs, a local attorney, and tricks his parents into signing a power of attorney so he can sell the station and the family house, and send them to live on a poor farm.  Late at night, Mrs. Fitch hears the sound of a carriage outside her home. When she goes to investigate, she finds her beloved flower beds mysteriously dead. As she begins to sob, she is dragged into the ground by various disembodied hands that emerges from the earth. The next day, Morgan, an indigent widowed farmer, visits the bank to cash out funds gifted to him by the wealthy Jess Hill to purchase seed for his crops. Sharpe refuses, however, and later, Sharpe and the sheriff arrive to repossess Morgan's house, leaving him homeless. While inspecting the property, Sharpe is locked in a cellar by the cloaked figure, and subsequently attacked and killed.  Meanwhile, George's ex-fiancÃ©, Missy, visits the service station with Griggs, and finds George inside, shaken and unable to speak. Nearby, Harvey Kaylor, the proprietor of the local clothing mercantile, prepares to leave town to purchase a lavish ring for his greedy and superficial younger wife, Ruby. Ruby, who is married to Harvey only for his money, is having an affair with Kenny, one of their employees. After Harvey leaves, Kenny visits their home to have sex with Ruby, but Harvey returns unexpectedly. Harvey and Kenny argue, and Kenny pushes Harvey into a fireplace mantel, causing him to hit his head and die. Ruby and Kenny place Harvey's body in his car and push it down an embankment, causing it to explode. Later that night, Ruby is terrified by a figure at the window. Lightning strikes the house, causing a fire, and both Ruby and Kenny are burned alive.  The Reaper's last victim is Charlie Milford, a crestfallen and jealous local businessman, who is convinced his wife, Grace, is having an affair with his superior, Sid Martin. Charlie's irrational jealousy has caused Grace to leave him, but Charlie has sustained a campaign of harassment against Sid. In a rage, Charlie kidnaps Sid and Grace, drives them into the woods, and executes them. Moments later, he is confronted by the Reaper, who decapitates him.  Each of the victims are seemingly led by the Reaper through darkness, and ultimately, into hell, but each suddenly awaken in their beds, terrifiedâ€”the events that have led them to their damnation were all simply nightmares. Now, fearful of the damnation they foresaw, each seek absolution, and attend church to hear the new Reverend's sermon. They look on in terror when they see the new Reverend, who enters in a black cloak, but are relieved when he removes it and introduces himself, suggesting that he already knows some of them."

He has not had a seizure in five months and is visiting the nation's most praised doctor. Due to his two-weekly visits to Dr. Tobin, he has been neglecting school work. This upsets his parents, who are disappointed considering the joy they experienced months earlier when they could enroll Kellin in a regular high school for the first time in his life. To better his grades, he is assigned to a tutor student, Susie Fratelli, whom he immediately falls in love with.

A Fine Mess (film),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Finemessposter.jpg,"While filming on location at a race track, womanizing bit actor Spencer Holden, who lives life on one scam after another, overhears a couple of inept thugs named Binky and Turnip while they dope a race horse with a supposed undetectable super stimulant. The thugs find out that Spence overheard them and will do anything to catch him to prevent him from going to the authorities with the information. Spence, however, enlists the help of his best friend, drive-in carhop and aspiring restaurateur Dennis Powell, to bet on the race with that horse so that they can make some guaranteed money. Spence and Dennis end up having to outrun not only the thugs, who manage to put a few bullet holes in Spence's car, but also the police after they find Spence's bullet-riddled car and after the race horse, Sorry Sue, dies from the drugs. The plot also includes an antique player piano of which Dennis comes into possession, sympathetic but naive auction house employee Ellen Frankenthaler who is attracted to Dennis, and exotically beautiful Claudia Pazzo, the wife of local Italian mob boss Tony Pazzo, who is interested in buying the piano and whom Spence can't resist."
A Fish Called Wanda,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9f/A_Fish_Called_Wanda_poster.jpg,"London-based gangster George Thomason plans a jewel heist with his right-hand man, Ken Pile, an animal lover with a stutter. They bring in two Americans: con artist Wanda Gershwitz and weapons expert Otto West, a volatile anglophobe. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but pretend to be siblings so Wanda can work her charms on Ken and George.   The heist succeeds and the gang escapes with a large sum in diamonds, which they hide. Wanda and Otto then betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the loot, with Wanda planning to double-cross Otto as well, but it is gone: suspecting duplicity, George had moved it to a safe deposit box and given Ken the key. Wanda sees Ken hide it in his fish tank, steals it, and conceals it in her locket.  To learn where the box is, Wanda decides to seduce George's barrister, Archie Leach. He is in a loveless marriage and quickly falls for her, but Otto's jealous interference causes their liaisons to go disastrously wrong. When Wanda accidentally leaves her locket at Archie's house his wife, Wendy, finds it and delightedly assumes it was a gift for her.  Wanda demands that Archie retrieve her keepsake, but Wendy will not give it up. He then fakes a robbery at his home as a cover for its disappearance. It too is interrupted and foiled by Otto.   Archie is later able to retrieve the locket,  and returns it to Wanda at their next tryst, this time unraveled by innocent intruders. Realizing he will be unable to give her all she seeks, he subsequently telephones her to call off their affair. Otto arrives at Archie's house seeking to apologise for his rudenesses, but Wendy overhears their conversation and learns of Archieâ€™s liaison.  George asks Ken to eliminate the Crown's only eyewitness to the robbery, the elderly Eileen Coady. Ken repeatedly tries, but each time accidentally kills one of her three small dogs instead, causing him great distress. Finally, the last's grisly death gives Mrs Coady a fatal heart attack. With no witness, George seems poised to be released. He gives instructions to Ken, revealing the location of the diamonds. When Otto learns that Ken knows this, he tortures him into revealing it by eating his various pet fish, leaving Ken's favourite, named Wanda, until last. Ken divulges that the diamonds are at the Cathcart Towers Hotel near Heathrow Airport, but does not know that Wanda has the key.  Even with Otto's knowledge and Wanda's key, the two still need George to remain in prison. Testifying as a defense witness at his trial, Wanda unexpectedly gives evidence incriminating him. Archie is stunned by her statements and flubs his questioning, inadvertently calling her ""darling"". Wendy, watching from the public gallery, declares their marriage dead.  Promising less prison time, Archie asks George about the diamonds and learns of Otto and Wanda's complicity and that Ken knows their location.   Archie sees Wanda fleeing the court and shunts her into his car. With his career and marriage ruined, Archie resolves to cut his losses, throw in with her, steal the loot, and flee to South America together.   They race to Ken's flat. While Archie interrogates him, Otto steals Archie's car, with Wanda in it. Archie painstakingly draws out from an uncontrollably stuttering Ken that the safe deposit box is at an airport hotel. They then set out for Heathrow on Ken's moped.  Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds, but Wanda double-crosses him and saps him unconscious in a Heathrow broom cupboard. She reluctantly boards her flight to Rio de Janeiro without Archie. Otto recovers, steals a boarding pass, and makes his way to the tarmac, where he is confronted by Archie. Otto is about to kill him, but is stalled while Ken approaches on a steamroller, seeking vengeance for his fish. Otto finds he has stepped in wet concrete and cannot move. Ken runs him over.   Archie joins Wanda aboard the plane. Improbably, Otto again appears seeking to derail things between them. Covered in encrusted cement, he clings outside their window until he is blown off during takeoff.  An epilogue relates that Archie and Wanda were married in Rio, had seventeen children, and founded a leper colony; Ken became Master of ceremonies at SeaWorld; and Otto became the Minister of Justice for South Africa."

Zoot Suit (film),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/Zoot_Suit_%28movie_poster%29.jpg,"In Zoot Suit, Luis Valdez weaves a story involving the real-life events of the Sleepy Lagoon murder trialâ€”when a group of young Mexican-Americans were charged with murderâ€”resulting in the racially fueled Zoot Suit Riots throughout Los Angeles. In the play, Henry Reyna (inspired by real-life defendant Hank Leyvas) is a pachuco gangster and his gang, who were unfairly prosecuted, are thrown in jail for a murder they did not commit. The play is set in the barrios of Los Angeles in the early 1940s against the backdrop of the Zoot Suit Riots and World War II. As in the play, Edward James Olmos portrays El Pachuco, an idealized Zoot Suiter, who functions as narrator throughout the story and serves as Henry's conscience.  The film starts out with singing and dancing at the party. Henry Reyna, a young Mexican American, gets arrested for murder by the LAPD a day before he leaves for the Navy at sleepy lagoon. Police officers then interrogate and beat him.  The film transitions to before everything happened back in his room where El Pachuco who is Henry's internal voice is standing next to his dresser and hands him a switchblade to put in his pocket after Henry gets dressed a zoot suit. Dolores has a bad feeling about him dressing in the zoot suit. The film presents a foreshadowing moment, as his mother wishes that he returned to jail instead of going to World War II in the Navy.  Henry and his friends were put in jail after being convicted with the murder of Jose Diaz at the sleepy lagoon, George Shearer comes to the jail cell where the boys are located to try and help them handle the murder case. Jose Castro, Ismael Torres, Thomas Roberts were the friends that were convicted with Henry. El Pachuco and Henry disagree with the lawyer because El Pachuco believes that Henry should not accept help from a white man.  In the film it flashbacks to the night of the dance. Rudy, Henry's brother, is drunk and tries to start a fight with Rafas but Henry breaks them up and goes back to dancing. Rafas then tries to touch on Della and pick on her, so Henry and Rafas fight with their switchblades out. El Pachuco pops up and begins talking to Henry and tells Henry that the right decision is to not kill him after Henry tackled Rafas and has him on the floor with a switchblade to his neck.  The next scene fast forwards to them in the courtroom and begins with Shearer letting the judge know that it has been two months since the boys have had a haircut or any clean clothes to make them look representable. The first person that goes up for the trial is Sergeant Frank Galindo from the Los Angeles Police Department. Galindo arrived at the scene where he found Jose Sanchez's dead body at the sleepy lagoon.  Della comes up as the next defendant and begins to explain her side of the story. She says that after the party she and Henry drove off to the sleepy lagoon lake and noticed that it was empty. They got out the car to enjoy the view and heard music at a party going on across the way. A car pulls up behind them who is accompanied by Rafas and his friends. The men threaten Henry and Della before smashing the car and fighting Henry.  When Henry woke up, he went to town and got his friends but by the time they return to where Rafas jumped him they were gone so they heard the music and headed to the party at the ranch, but they got attacked when Henry and his friends were mistaken for Rafas group. Della saw El Pachuco beating someone on the ground. George's objections kept getting denied in court by the judge and at the end of Dellas testimony she was sent to custody of Ventura state School for Girls.  The boys were found guilty in the first- and second-degree murder case of sleepy lagoon. Alice Bloomfield who is a newspaper writer is trying to help them get out and writes to them in jail saying that they will clear their name. Bloomfield shows up to jail and talks to Henry privately and says that he wants to drop out of the case. She argues back with him, but they make up and Henry decides to get back in the case, but Henry flirts with Bloomfield and she asked him to write an article and he says only if they write privately together.  Bloomfield revisits Henry and tells him how Della is doing at Ventura training institute, but Henry is mad at Bloomfield because she didn't write back to his love letters. She responds by saying that she doesn't want to lose her job after the case is over. Henry then kisses her and walks out. Henry gets put into solitary for 90 days for bad behavior and during this time in jail and solitary Henry is battling his inner thoughts with El Pachuco which starts to drive him crazy.  Della visits the Jail to see how Henry is doing and let him know that she is out of the Ventura girlsâ€™ school and got off four months for good behavior.  November 8, 1944, Henry, and the boys are released from the case for being wrongfully convicted."
"Zorro, The Gay Blade",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3b/Zorro_the_gay_blade.jpg,"In 1840s Madrid, Spain, Don Diego de la Vega is in bed with a married woman. They are caught by her husband, Garcia, and Diego must sword fight with him and his five brothers. During the altercation, Diego's mute servant Paco reads (via gestures) a letter from Diego's father ordering Diego's return to California. Diego and Paco jump from a high wall into a waiting carriage.  When the two arrive in Los Angeles months later, they are met by Diego's childhood friend Esteban, who is now capitÃ¡n of the guard. He has married Florinda, for whom the men competed when they were boys. Diego learns that his father was killed in a riding accident, his horse ""frightened by a turtle"". Esteban is the acting alcalde until the Dons elect a replacement.  Esteban is elected by acclamation and then gives a speech to the assembled peasants. He is interrupted by Charlotte Taylor-Wilson, a wealthy political activist from Boston. She and Diego meet, and despite their political differences, Diego is smitten.  Diego is invited to a masked ball celebrating Esteban's elevation. He also receives his inheritance: Zorro's black cape, hat, and sword, along with a letter from his late father revealing that he was Zorro. That legacy now falls to Diego. He decides the masked ball is the perfect place to announce Zorro's return. On his way there, Zorro witnesses a peasant being extorted. He confronts and defeats Esteban's tax collector, then instructs the peasant to spread the word that El Zorro has returned.  Diego, in Zorro costume, dances with Florinda at the ball. Velasquez, the tax collector, reports the theft to Esteban, pointing to Diego as Zorro. A duel ensues with Esteban, and Zorro escapes by again jumping from a high wall, but this time injuring his foot and hobbling away.  Later that night, a drunken Florinda attempts to seduce Diego at his hacienda, but Esteban arrives to speak about the evening's events. He suspects that Diego might be Zorro, but Diego convinces him that his foot is uninjured.  A reign of terror begins, including torture and increased taxation. Diego is frustrated because, being injured, he cannot fight Esteban's tyranny. Fate intervenes when Diego's gay, foppish, and British-educated twin brother RamÃ³n de la Vega, a Royal Navy officer having adopted the name ""Bunny Wigglesworth"", comes home for a visit. Diego brings him up to date, and Bunny assumes the guise of Zorro, using a whip instead of a sword, while wearing flamboyant Zorro attire in a variety of coordinated colors.  The colorful Zorro always eludes capture. Esteban hatches a plan to lure Zorro to the alcalde's residence with another ball to show off Florinda's expensive new necklace. Seeing through the plan, Diego arrives dressed as Zorro. So do the rest of the Dons and male party guests, saying that a message from Esteban instructed them all to dress that way. Adding to the confusion, Bunny appears in drag, masquerading as ""Margarita"" Wigglesworth, Diego's cousin from Santa Barbara. Esteban is smitten upon meeting her. Bunny spills a drink on Florinda, and in the resulting chaos attempts to clean her dress, and makes off with the necklace. As Bunny leaves to return to the Royal Navy, he tells Diego that Charlotte Taylor-Wilson has confessed her love for Zorro.  At the plaza, Diego (as Zorro) and Charlotte meet again, falling into each other's arms, but they are observed and Esteban is informed. As a ruse to lure Zorro, he has Charlotte arrested, and she is sentenced to be executed. Don Diego as Zorro surrenders to Esteban to save her, and he is sentenced to death.  Seconds before the firing squad opens fire, Bunny, this time wearing a bright metallic gold costume, announces the return of Zorro with a rhyme, ""Two bits, four bits, six bits, a peso. All for Zorro, stand up and say so!"" With Charlotte's and Diego's aid, Zorro incites the assembled peasants to rebellion. Esteban's guards also rebel, joined by Florinda, and Esteban stands alone, defeated. Later, Bunny finally rides off to catch his ship back to Britain, waving goodbye, after which Diego and Charlotte ride off to plan their wedding. As her wedding gift, Charlotte suggests that Diego donate all his family lands to the people, so they can settle down and raise a family in Boston."
